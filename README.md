# Coders Guild Portfolio Project

cat-mugs.netlify.app

Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript, build a website. Must include form validation.


## My goals for the project
payment details validation:
* prevent default on submission
* if numbers entered do not meet submission criteria; validation message
* submission criteria:
** name can only be letters
** card number must only be 16 digits (UI push; can we put spaces between every 4?)
** expiry date only 2 numbers in each
** cvc number can only be 3 numbers
* clear form after submission and pop up with success!
* push goal: payment details only visible once place order clicked?
* push: pop up for success?
shopping cart:
* click add to card- adds item to cart
* if item already in cart, add 1 to quantity
* control quantities with + or -
* must not go below 0
* update price with quantity
* update total
* remove buttons to remove item from cart
* show amount of items in cart next to shopping cart icon in navbar
